    "question": "What is the purpose of the `range(1, 10)` function in the program?",
    "options": [
      "It creates a list of numbers from 1 to 9.",
      "It checks if each number is even.",
      "It prints the numbers from 1 to 9.",
      "It calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 9."
    ],
    "answer": "0",
    "explanation": "The `range(1, 10)` function generates a sequence of numbers from 1 (inclusive) to 10 (exclusive), which the loop iterates over."
  },
  {
    "segment": 2,
    "difficulty": 5,
    "question": "How does the program determine if a number is even?",
    "options": [
      "It divides the number by 2 and checks if the result is a whole number.",
      "It uses the modulo operator (%) to check if the remainder is 0 when divided by 2.",
      "It compares the number to a list of known even numbers.",
      "It checks if the number is divisible by both 2 and 4."
    ],
    "answer": "1",
    "explanation": "The expression `number % 2 == 0` checks if the remainder is 0 when the number is divided by 2, which is a characteristic of even numbers."

    "question": "What is the role of the `count` variable?",
    "options": [
      "It stores the sum of even numbers.",
      "It keeps track of the number of even numbers found.",
      "It holds the current number being processed in the loop.",
      "It determines the range of numbers to iterate over."
    ],
    "answer": "1",
    "explanation": "The `count` variable is incremented each time an even number is identified, thus counting the total number of even numbers."

    "question": "What is the output of the following code snippet: `print(f\"We have {count} even numbers.\")`?",
    "options": [
      "It prints the value of the `count` variable.",
      "It displays a message with the total count of even numbers.", 
      "It shows the list of even numbers found.",
      "It prints the range of numbers used in the loop."
    ],
    "answer": "1",
    "explanation": "The f-string formats the message by inserting the value of the `count` variable, resulting in a statement like \"We have 4 even numbers.\""
