    "options": [
      "To store a list of objects",
      "To create repetition in tasks",
      "To check conditions and execute code based on them",
      "To define functions"
    ],
    "answer": 1,
    "explanation": "Loops are used to repeat a block of code multiple times, making tasks more efficient and avoiding code duplication."

    "question": "What does the `range(3)` function do?",
    "options": [
      "Creates a list of numbers from 0 to 2",
      "Creates a list of numbers from 1 to 3",
      "Creates a range object that generates numbers from 0 to 2",
      "Creates a range object that generates numbers from 1 to 3"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "The `range(n)` function generates numbers from 0 up to (but not including) n. It returns a range object, not a list."

    "question": "How do you exit a loop early in Python?",
    "options": [
      "Using the `exit()` function",
      "Using the `return` statement",
      "Using the `break` statement",
      "Using the `continue` statement"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "The `break` statement immediately terminates the loop and continues execution after the loop."

    "difficulty": 6,
    "question": "What is the purpose of the `else` block in a `for...else` loop?",
    "options": [
      "It executes if the loop condition is false",
      "It executes if the loop variable reaches its maximum value",
      "It executes if the loop completes without encountering a `break` statement",
      "It executes if an error occurs within the loop"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "The `else` block only runs if the loop finishes naturally, meaning it didn't exit early due to a `break` statement."

    "segment": 3,
    "difficulty": 7,
    "question": "What is a nested loop?",
    "options": [
      "A loop inside another loop",
      "A loop with multiple conditions",
      "A loop that iterates over a range of values",
      "A loop that uses recursion"
    ],
    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "A nested loop is when one loop is placed within the body of another loop, creating a loop within a loop."

    "question": "What type of object does the `range()` function return?",
    "options": [
      "A list",
      "A tuple",
      "An integer",
      "A range object"
    ],
    "answer": 3,
    "explanation": "The `range()` function returns a range object, which is an iterable sequence of numbers."

  {
    "segment": 4,
    "difficulty": 9,
    "question": "What does it mean for an object to be iterable?",
    "options": [
      "It can be used in mathematical calculations",
      "It can be assigned to a variable",
      "It can be used in a `for` loop",
      "It has a fixed size"
    ],
    "answer": 2,
    "explanation": "An iterable object can be used in a `for` loop, meaning you can iterate over its elements one by one."
