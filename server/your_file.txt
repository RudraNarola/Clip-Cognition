 Alright, time for an exercise. I want you to write a program to display the even numbers between 1 to 10. So when you run this program, you should see 2, 4, 6 and 8. And after these, I want you to print this message. We have 4 even numbers. Now here is a quick hint before you get started. You should call the range function with 1 and 10. Do not use the third argument, which is called step. So basically, I want you to iterate over all the numbers between 1 to 10. Check if each number is an even number and then printed on the terminal. So pause the video, spend 2 minutes on this exercise when you're done, come back, continue watching. So we start with a for loop for number in range, 1 to 10, colon. We check to see if the remainder of division... of this number by 2 equals 0. So if number modulus 2 equals 0, then reprint this number. Now let's run this program. So we get 2468. Beautiful. Now to count the even numbers, we need a separate variable. So let's call that count. Initially we set it to 0. Now in this if block, every time we find an even number, we need to increment count. So we set count plus equals 1. And finally, after our for loop, we can print a formatted string. We have count even numbers. Let's run the program. And here's the result.
